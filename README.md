# Description
An abridged implementation of this tutorial, [Clock: a simple time display]
[Clock].

# Review
This was a simple but lame tutorial. The author tells you what to do without
explanation and as such I found it to be a difficult introduction into Unity.
For Unity newbies I recommend watching video tutorials. Then, once you're
comfortable with Unity concepts revisit Catlike Coding.
